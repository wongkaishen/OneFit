## Questions to confirm

1. **AI features** are intentionally 501 stubs per CLAUDE.md ("501 is a feature"). Should the report treat them as *missing* or *intentionally deferred*? (Currently marked ⚙️ deferred.)
2. **Workout plan Edit/Discard** (A6/A7) — these are genuinely absent. Do you want them added, or were they meant to be AI-only flows?
3. **Specialist Tasks & Community** (B8/B17/B18) — backend is built but there are no frontend pages. Should I count these as done (API contract exists) or flag for UI work?
4. Should "Pending Admin Approval" stay active-on-signup (current behavior) or actually block login until approved?
